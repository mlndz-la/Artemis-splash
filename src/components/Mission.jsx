        Matthew Arnold, a Victorian poet, once claimed, “The crown of literature
        is poetry,” and if our neglect of poetry is any indication, the crown is
        rusting. While books sales fluctuate from year to year, fewer and fewer
        publishing houses are printing volumes of poetry. The demand for poets
        and their poems has ebbed. However, we do ourselves a great disservice
        when we neglect the reading of poetry. John Adams, one of the founding
        fathers of the United States, commended poetry to his son John Quincy.
        Both Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt committed their favorite
        poems to memory. Ancient kings were expected to produce poetry while
        also being versed in warfare and statecraft. That poetry has fallen out
        of favor among men in the 21st century is a recent trend rather than the
        norm. To help remedy this, we have compiled a list of 20 classic poems
        that every man should read. Spanning the past two thousand years, the
        poems on this list represent some of the best works of poetry ever
        composed. But don’t worry—they were selected for both their brevity and
        ease of application. Some are about striving to overcome, others about
        romantic love, and still others about patriotism. Whether you’ve been
        reading poetry for years or haven’t read a single line since high
        school, these poems are sure to inspire and delight you.
